description:

What you need are cameras with boards where the lens is attached to the board using a lens holder with m12-0,5 screw thread (not soldered). 
Now you can exchange the cheap lenses with the lens of the ELP cameras. 
Make sure the lens holder is no higher than 10mm from the board, otherwise you will not get a sharp image with the elp lens
(If necessary, use a 3d-printed version).
